# Inform your tutor #

Use the `adviseMe.md` file to tell your tutor what you want help with.
The tutor may prefer to give you feedback on other aspects.

# Develop the main application #

After you have completed these To Do lists, or currently while doing
them, develop your application in the `src/application` package.

If you really wish, you may skip some, most, or even all of the To Do
tasks, and just build your own application.
