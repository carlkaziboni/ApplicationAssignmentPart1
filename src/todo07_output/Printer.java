    /* TODO This class has been written in an imperative style: meaning there
            are parameters everywhere. Once you have got the functionality
            (more or less) working, you need to move the code into more
            appropriate places. Refresh your memory of the Code Quality document
            about potatoes. An imperative potato is passed as a parameter
            to a "boil" method (along with many other parameters such as cooking
            time, volume of water, amount of salt, amount of 10 other things
            that go in the water). An object-oriented potato knows how to boil
            itself, so it needs no parameters, it's simply a case of calling
            the potato's .boil() method. All the other information (volume of
            water, amount of this, that, and the other) is either already
            stored in the potato or is requested from other objects as needed.
            This means that an Assignment should know how to calculate its own
            duration and hours per day, and how to print itself. The application
            has a single configuration object so it can tell an Assignment
            what printing format to use.
